# Nikhail Singh Assignment 2

This assignment contains 2 pieces:
1. A CV written in elm
2. A Web app
## CV
My CV can be viewed from [index.html](https://github.com/singhn18/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign2/index.html) and it's source code written in elm is found at [NikhailCV.elm](https://github.com/singhn18/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign2/NikhailCV.elm) 

My CV was based on the Orbit template written by **Xiaoying Riley** I found online because I liked the clean simple look it had and because it was very compact. Link to that here: [Orbit](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/website-templates/orbit-free-resume-cv-template-for-developers/)

## Elm Web App
for my web app I decided to make a simple application that does a few different animations on the screen depending on different user input from either the keyboard and the mouse. It also contains instructions on how to do the different animations on screen.
My web app can be viewed here: [web App](https://github.com/singhn18/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign2/anim.html)
And it's source code here:     [Elm source](https://github.com/singhn18/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign2/Anim.elm)
