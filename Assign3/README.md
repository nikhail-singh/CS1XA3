# Nikhail Singh Assignment 3

## Description
This assignment is a math expression analyzer that can evaluate different mathematical expressions for the following types of expressions
1.  addition
2. subtraction
3. multiplication
4. division
5. Natural Logarithms
6. exponents (a^x)
7. e^x
8 basic trig (sin, cos, tan)

In addition to being able to evaluate these mathematical expressions the program can also simplify expressions display them out and parse strings into the expression datatype for evaluation for the format see the documentation for [ExprParser.hs](https://github.com/singhn18/CS1XA3/blob/master/Assign3/ExprParser.hs).
